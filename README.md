## Inconsistent names of Voidpets

Using all adjectives would make us start using past participles for more complex emotions like "estranged", which is awkward because it implies that one is the passive recipient of an action instead of the active player in an emotional experience. Using nouns is also awkward because we'd be overly reliant on the suffix "ness", which would be repetitive and take up a lot of space on a mobile UI. Also, there are occurrences where naming a creature a noun like "Anxiety" can send the wrong message by impling something like clinical anxiety is just an emotion. Some expressions, like "Down Bad", don't even exist properly as nouns. We don't want to name something "Down Badness", "A Down Bad Individual", or "The State of Being Down Bad".

We use both nouns and adjectives to talk concisely about emotions, just as we can use both memes and traditional vocabularly to express ourselves in different situations. Therefore, it's important that the naming schema is flexible enough to capture a full range of emotional expressions without a forced restriction of words to a single part of speech. Plus - some words just sound better as nouns, and some sound better as adjectives.
